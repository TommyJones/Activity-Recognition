# Activity-Recognition

This repository satisfies the project requirement for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" portion of the Coursera/John Hopkins Data Science specialization. It contains R scripts to create a tidy version of the [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) provided by the [UCI machine learning repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/about.html).

# Prerequisites
This procedure does not include code to download the data. The data must be downloaded manually and extracted to a folder named "UCI HAR Dataset" within R's working directory.

# Contents
`run_analysis.R` - the primary procedure to tidy the data.

`CodeBook.md` - description of the specific procedure applied and the resulting tidy data set.

`README.md` - this file.
